## Language

Write all files and code in English, including comments and documentation.
When you answer, use the same language as the user's question (but all generated files and code should be in English).

## Documentation

When you develop components of the core library (uilint), keep actual documentation in ./docs folder.
When you make changes in the code of the core library, update the documentation in ./docs folder.

## Context7

Use context7 MCP to get actual documentation for libraries and tools.

## Galen Framework

We are building a framework for testing and developing web applications. It is something like Galen Framework,
but on top of Playwright and with typescript declarative approach.

By the way, use Context7 MCP to get documentation for Galen Framework to understand better, what we are building.

Also, check the difference between Galen Framework and uiling (this project) at PRD.md file.
